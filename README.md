Bézier Curves and B-splines: Applications and Utility
Bézier curves and B-spline curves are fundamental tools in computer graphics, design, and engineering for several reasons:
Why These Curves Are Useful

Intuitive Control: Both provide intuitive control through control points that designers can manipulate directly.
Mathematical Stability: They have predictable mathematical properties that ensure smooth results.
Compact Representation: Complex shapes can be represented with relatively few control points.
Invariance Properties: They maintain their shape under transformations like rotation and translation.

Practical Applications
Font Design: Typography relies heavily on Bézier curves to define letter shapes. When you see text on a screen or in print, you're looking at Bézier curves that define each character's outline. The control points allow font designers to create precise curves that maintain their quality at any resolution.
